<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/MinusRF/AirStylus/blob/main/Demo-04.png)

Air Stylus is a color detection based Pen-Tablet system. It tends to provide all basic features of a regular pen tablet system like, multi-color drawing option, width adjustment option, background switch, eraser etc. Concepts like Morphology, Erosion and Dilation play a very important role in the process. Project was build in Python, with OpenCV library.  Being able to draw in Air feels like magic and I absolutely recommend you to try it in your systems. 

### Built With

* [Python - 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [OpenCV 4.2.0](https://opencv.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started 

* Copy the code in your prefered IDE
* Import the missing packages - This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them :
   pip intall -[PACKAGE-NAME]
* Make sure to have a web cam (Default), incase of external cameras use modify code (cv2.videoCapture(0) to cv2.VideoCapture(1))
* If blue color object is not getting deteced, adjust blue_upper and blue_lower values, and avoid having too bright background and anyother blue colored object other than pen.
